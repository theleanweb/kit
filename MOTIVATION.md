In today's web development landscape, we encounter a plethora of specialized tools dedicated to handling JavaScript - whether it's transforming, transpiling, or minifying it. The prevailing trend seems to be centered around building everything with JavaScript and subsequently attempting to optimize our creations using even more JavaScript. Unfortunately, this approach has led to an escalating level of complexity, resulting in a slower and less efficient web experience for all.

Regrettably, there are not many comprehensive tools designed to address the entire web development stack, encompassing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I delved deeper into web development, I couldn't help but grow increasingly frustrated with the intricate and convoluted nature of modern web application development.

It was out of this frustration that Lean Web Kit was conceived. This toolkit aims to bridge the significant gap in web development. Bring the joy of building web applications the traditional way, with modern benefits of transpilation, asset handling etc. With Lean Web Kit, you won't find the complexities of JavaScript, nor will you be immersed in the cacophony of JavaScript frameworks and tooling. Instead, it encourages you to begin your application journey with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, with the option to incorporate JavaScript for interactivity when needed. In essence, it offers a more streamlined and efficient approach to web development.
